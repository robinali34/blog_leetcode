# System Design Interview Framework: A Structured Approach

System design interviews can be challenging, but following a structured framework helps you demonstrate your thinking process and architectural knowledge effectively. This guide provides a comprehensive framework to tackle any system design problem systematically.

## The 5-Step Framework

### 1. Define the Problem Scope
### 2. Design the System at a High Level
### 3. Deep Dive into the Design
### 4. Identify Bottlenecks and Scaling Opportunities
### 5. Review and Wrap Up

---

## Step 1: Define the Problem Scope

**Time Allocation: 5-10 minutes**

Before diving into the design, it's crucial to understand what you're building and clarify requirements.

### Key Questions to Ask

#### Functional Requirements
- **What is the core functionality?** What does the system do?
- **Who are the users?** End users, admins, third-party integrations?
- **What are the key features?** List the main capabilities
- **What are the user workflows?** How do users interact with the system?

#### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Scale requirements:** How many users, requests per second, data volume?
- **Performance:** What are the latency requirements?
- **Availability:** What's the acceptable downtime?
- **Consistency:** Strong, eventual, or eventual consistency?
- **Security:** Authentication, authorization, data protection?

#### Constraints and Assumptions
- **Technology constraints:** Any specific technologies required?
- **Budget constraints:** Cost considerations?
- **Timeline:** Development timeline?
- **Geographic distribution:** Global, regional, or local?

### Example Clarification Questions

```
Interviewer: "Design a URL shortener like bit.ly"

Your Questions:
- How many URLs will be shortened per day? (e.g., 100M)
- How many reads per day? (e.g., 1B)
- What's the URL length limit? (e.g., 2048 chars)
- How long should URLs be stored? (e.g., 5 years)
- Should we support custom short URLs?
- What's the acceptable latency? (e.g., <200ms)
- Should we support analytics/tracking?
- What's the acceptable availability? (e.g., 99.9%)
```

### Common Scale Numbers to Remember

| Metric | Small | Medium | Large | Very Large |
|--------|-------|--------|-------|------------|
| Users | 1K | 100K | 10M | 100M+ |
| Requests/sec | 100 | 10K | 100K | 1M+ |
| Data Volume | 1GB | 100GB | 10TB | 1PB+ |
| Storage | 1GB | 100GB | 10TB | 1PB+ |

## Step 2: Design the System at a High Level

**Time Allocation: 10-15 minutes**

Create a high-level architecture diagram showing major components and their interactions.

### Components to Consider

#### Core Components
- **Client Applications:** Web, mobile, API clients
- **Load Balancer:** Distribute traffic across servers
- **Web Servers:** Handle HTTP requests
- **Application Servers:** Business logic processing
- **Database:** Data persistence
- **Cache:** Improve performance
- **CDN:** Content delivery

#### Supporting Components
- **Message Queue:** Asynchronous processing
- **Search Engine:** Full-text search
- **File Storage:** Images, documents, media
- **Monitoring:** System health and metrics
- **Logging:** Application and system logs

### High-Level Architecture Example

```
[Client] → [Load Balancer] → [Web Servers] → [Application Servers] → [Database]
                ↓
            [CDN] ← [Cache] ← [Message Queue]
```

### Key Principles

#### 1. **Separation of Concerns**
- Each component has a single responsibility
- Clear interfaces between components
- Loose coupling between services

#### 2. **Scalability**
- Horizontal scaling over vertical scaling
- Stateless services where possible
- Database sharding strategies

#### 3. **Reliability**
- Redundancy at every level
- Failover mechanisms
- Circuit breakers

#### 4. **Performance**
- Caching strategies
- CDN for static content
- Database optimization

### Common Patterns

#### Microservices Architecture
```
[API Gateway] → [Service A] → [Database A]
              → [Service B] → [Database B]
              → [Service C] → [Database C]
```

#### Event-Driven Architecture
```
[Client] → [API] → [Event Bus] → [Service A]
                              → [Service B]
                              → [Service C]
```

## Step 3: Deep Dive into the Design

**Time Allocation: 20-25 minutes**

Now dive into the details of each component and their interactions.

### Database Design

#### Database Selection
- **SQL:** ACID compliance, complex queries, relational data
- **NoSQL:** High scalability, flexible schema, document/key-value stores
- **Time-series:** Metrics, logs, IoT data
- **Graph:** Social networks, recommendations

#### Database Patterns
- **Master-Slave Replication:** Read scaling
- **Master-Master Replication:** High availability
- **Sharding:** Horizontal partitioning
- **Denormalization:** Performance optimization

#### Example: URL Shortener Database Schema
```sql
-- URLs table
CREATE TABLE urls (
    id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,
    short_url VARCHAR(10) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    long_url TEXT NOT NULL,
    user_id BIGINT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP,
    expires_at TIMESTAMP,
    click_count BIGINT DEFAULT 0
);

-- Users table
CREATE TABLE users (
    id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,
    email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP
);

-- Analytics table
CREATE TABLE analytics (
    id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,
    short_url VARCHAR(10),
    ip_address VARCHAR(45),
    user_agent TEXT,
    referrer TEXT,
    clicked_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

### API Design

#### RESTful API Principles
- **Resource-based URLs:** `/api/v1/users/{id}`
- **HTTP methods:** GET, POST, PUT, DELETE
- **Status codes:** 200, 201, 400, 404, 500
- **Pagination:** `?page=1&limit=20`
- **Versioning:** `/api/v1/`, `/api/v2/`

#### Example API Endpoints
```
POST /api/v1/shorten
{
    "long_url": "https://example.com/very-long-url",
    "custom_alias": "optional",
    "expires_in": 3600
}

GET /api/v1/{short_code}
Response: 302 Redirect to long URL

GET /api/v1/analytics/{short_code}
{
    "short_code": "abc123",
    "total_clicks": 1500,
    "unique_clicks": 1200,
    "top_countries": ["US", "CA", "UK"],
    "click_timeline": [...]
}
```

### Caching Strategy

#### Cache Levels
1. **Browser Cache:** Static assets, CSS, JS
2. **CDN Cache:** Global content delivery
3. **Application Cache:** Redis, Memcached
4. **Database Cache:** Query result caching

#### Cache Patterns
- **Cache-Aside:** Application manages cache
- **Write-Through:** Write to cache and database
- **Write-Behind:** Write to cache, async to database
- **Refresh-Ahead:** Proactive cache refresh

#### Example: URL Shortener Caching
```python
# Cache frequently accessed URLs
def get_url(short_code):
    # Try cache first
    cached_url = cache.get(f"url:{short_code}")
    if cached_url:
        return cached_url
    
    # Fallback to database
    url = database.get_url_by_short_code(short_code)
    if url:
        # Cache for 1 hour
        cache.set(f"url:{short_code}", url, ttl=3600)
    
    return url
```

### Data Flow Design

#### Request Flow
1. **Client** sends request
2. **Load Balancer** routes to server
3. **Web Server** handles HTTP
4. **Application Server** processes business logic
5. **Cache** checked for data
6. **Database** queried if needed
7. **Response** sent back to client

#### Example: URL Shortening Flow
```
1. Client POST /api/shorten with long URL
2. Load balancer routes to web server
3. Web server validates request
4. Application server generates short code
5. Check cache for existing mapping
6. If not cached, query database
7. If not found, create new mapping
8. Store in database and cache
9. Return short URL to client
```

## Step 4: Identify Bottlenecks and Scaling Opportunities

**Time Allocation: 10-15 minutes**

Analyze potential bottlenecks and propose scaling solutions.

### Common Bottlenecks

#### 1. **Database Bottlenecks**
- **Problem:** Single database can't handle load
- **Solutions:**
  - Read replicas for read scaling
  - Database sharding by user ID or geographic region
  - Caching frequently accessed data
  - Database connection pooling

#### 2. **Application Server Bottlenecks**
- **Problem:** CPU/memory limitations
- **Solutions:**
  - Horizontal scaling (more servers)
  - Load balancing across servers
  - Microservices architecture
  - Asynchronous processing

#### 3. **Network Bottlenecks**
- **Problem:** Bandwidth limitations
- **Solutions:**
  - CDN for static content
  - Data compression
  - HTTP/2 for multiplexing
  - Edge computing

#### 4. **Storage Bottlenecks**
- **Problem:** Disk I/O limitations
- **Solutions:**
  - SSD storage
  - Distributed file systems
  - Object storage (S3, GCS)
  - Data partitioning

### Scaling Strategies

#### Horizontal Scaling (Scale Out)
- Add more servers/machines
- Distribute load across multiple instances
- Requires load balancing
- Stateless application design

#### Vertical Scaling (Scale Up)
- Increase CPU, memory, storage
- Easier to implement
- Limited by hardware constraints
- More expensive at scale

#### Database Scaling
```
Single DB → Read Replicas → Sharding → Distributed DB
```

#### Example: URL Shortener Scaling
```
Initial: 1 server, 1 database
↓
Scale 1: Multiple servers, 1 database with read replicas
↓
Scale 2: Multiple servers, sharded database
↓
Scale 3: Microservices, distributed databases, CDN
```

### Performance Optimization

#### 1. **Caching**
- **Browser Cache:** Static assets
- **CDN Cache:** Global content delivery
- **Application Cache:** Redis/Memcached
- **Database Cache:** Query result caching

#### 2. **Database Optimization**
- **Indexing:** Proper indexes on frequently queried columns
- **Query Optimization:** Efficient SQL queries
- **Connection Pooling:** Reuse database connections
- **Read Replicas:** Distribute read load

#### 3. **Asynchronous Processing**
- **Message Queues:** Decouple services
- **Background Jobs:** Process heavy tasks asynchronously
- **Event-Driven Architecture:** React to events

#### 4. **CDN and Edge Computing**
- **Static Content:** Images, CSS, JS files
- **API Caching:** Cache API responses
- **Edge Functions:** Process requests closer to users

### Monitoring and Observability

#### Key Metrics to Monitor
- **Latency:** Response time percentiles (p50, p95, p99)
- **Throughput:** Requests per second
- **Error Rate:** Percentage of failed requests
- **Availability:** Uptime percentage
- **Resource Utilization:** CPU, memory, disk usage

#### Monitoring Tools
- **APM:** Application Performance Monitoring
- **Logging:** Centralized log aggregation
- **Metrics:** Time-series databases
- **Alerting:** Automated incident response
