# LC 1207: Unique Number of Occurrences

**Difficulty:** Easy  
**Category:** Array, Hash Table  
**Companies:** Amazon, Google, Microsoft

## Problem Statement

Given an array of integers `arr`, return `true` if the number of occurrences of each value in the array is **unique**, or `false` otherwise.

### Examples

**Example 1:**
```
Input: arr = [1,2,2,1,1,3]
Output: true
Explanation: The value 1 has 3 occurrences, 2 has 2 occurrences, and 3 has 1 occurrence. No two values have the same number of occurrences.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: arr = [1,2]
Output: false
Explanation: The value 1 has 1 occurrence, and 2 has 1 occurrence. Two values have the same number of occurrences.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: arr = [-3,0,1,-3,1,1,1,-3,10,0]
Output: true
Explanation: The value -3 has 3 occurrences, 0 has 2 occurrences, 1 has 4 occurrences, and 10 has 1 occurrence. No two values have the same number of occurrences.
```

### Constraints

- `1 <= arr.length <= 1000`
- `-1000 <= arr[i] <= 1000`

## Solution Approaches

### Approach 1: Hash Map + Hash Set (Recommended)

**Algorithm:**
1. Count frequency of each element using hash map
2. Store all frequencies in a hash set
3. Check if hash set size equals hash map size (no duplicate frequencies)

**Time Complexity:** O(n)  
**Space Complexity:** O(n)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool uniqueOccurrences(vector<int>& arr) {
        unordered_map<int, int> freqs;
        unordered_set<int> occurs;
        for(int num: arr) freqs[num]++;

        for(auto& [num, freq]: freqs)
            occurs.insert(freq);
        return occurs.size() == freqs.size();
    }
};
```

### Approach 2: Early Termination Optimization

**Algorithm:**
1. Count frequency of each element using hash map
2. While inserting frequencies into hash set, check for duplicates
3. Return false immediately if duplicate frequency found

**Time Complexity:** O(n)  
**Space Complexity:** O(n)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool uniqueOccurrences(vector<int>& arr) {
        unordered_map<int, int> freqs;
        unordered_set<int> occurs;
        for(int num: arr) freqs[num]++;

        for(auto& [_, freq]: freqs)
            if(!occurs.insert(freq).second) return false;

        return occurs.size() == freqs.size();
    }
};
```

### Approach 3: Array-Based Counting

**Algorithm:**
1. Use array to count frequencies (since values are in range [-1000, 1000])
2. Use another array to count frequency counts
3. Check if any frequency count exceeds 1

**Time Complexity:** O(n)  
**Space Complexity:** O(1) - fixed size arrays

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool uniqueOccurrences(vector<int>& arr) {
        int freq[2001] = {0};  // Offset by 1000 for negative numbers
        int count[1001] = {0}; // Max frequency is 1000
        
        // Count frequencies
        for(int num : arr) {
            freq[num + 1000]++;
        }
        
        // Count frequency counts
        for(int i = 0; i < 2001; i++) {
            if(freq[i] > 0) {
                count[freq[i]]++;
                if(count[freq[i]] > 1) return false;
            }
        }
        
        return true;
    }
};
```

## Algorithm Analysis

### Approach Comparison

| Approach | Time | Space | Pros | Cons |
|----------|------|-------|------|------|
| Hash Map + Set | O(n) | O(n) | Simple, readable | Extra space for set |
| Early Termination | O(n) | O(n) | Early exit optimization | Slightly more complex |
| Array Counting | O(n) | O(1) | Constant space | Limited to small ranges |

### Key Insights

1. **Frequency Counting**: Use hash map to count occurrences of each element
2. **Duplicate Detection**: Use hash set to detect duplicate frequencies
3. **Size Comparison**: If set size equals map size, all frequencies are unique
4. **Early Termination**: Can optimize by checking for duplicates during insertion

## Implementation Details

### Hash Set Insert Behavior
```cpp
// insert() returns pair<iterator, bool>
// second is true if insertion successful (no duplicate)
if(!occurs.insert(freq).second) return false;
```

### Array Offset Technique
```cpp
// Offset by 1000 to handle negative numbers
freq[num + 1000]++;
```

## Edge Cases

1. **Single Element**: `[1]` → true (frequency 1 is unique)
2. **All Same Elements**: `[1,1,1]` → true (frequency 3 is unique)
3. **All Different Elements**: `[1,2,3]` → true (all frequencies are 1)
4. **Duplicate Frequencies**: `[1,2,2,3]` → false (both 1 and 3 have frequency 1)

## Follow-up Questions

- What if the array could contain very large numbers?
- How would you handle floating-point numbers?
- What if you needed to find which frequencies are duplicated?
- How would you optimize for very large arrays?

## Optimization Techniques

1. **Early Termination**: Stop as soon as duplicate frequency is found
2. **Space Optimization**: Use arrays instead of hash maps for small ranges
3. **Memory Efficiency**: Avoid storing unnecessary data
4. **Cache Performance**: Array-based approach has better cache locality

## Code Quality Notes

1. **Readability**: First approach is most readable and maintainable
2. **Performance**: Array approach is fastest for small ranges
3. **Scalability**: Hash map approach works for any range
4. **Robustness**: All approaches handle edge cases correctly
