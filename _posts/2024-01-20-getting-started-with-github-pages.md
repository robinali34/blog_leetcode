GitHub Pages is a static site hosting service that takes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files straight from a repository on GitHub, optionally runs the files through a build process, and publishes a website.

## Setting Up Your Repository

To get started with GitHub Pages, you'll need to create a repository. For a personal blog, you can use the format `username.github.io` where `username` is your GitHub username.

### Repository Setup Steps:

1. **Create a new repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone the repository** to your local machine
3. **Add your Jekyll files** (like the ones we've created)
4. **Push to GitHub** and your site will be live!

## Custom Domain (Optional)

You can also use a custom domain with GitHub Pages:

1. Add a `CNAME` file to your repository root
2. Configure your DNS settings
3. Update your `_config.yml` with the custom domain

## Benefits of GitHub Pages

- **Free hosting** for public repositories
- **Automatic builds** when you push changes
- **SSL certificates** provided automatically
- **Custom domains** supported
- **Jekyll integration** built-in
